# Bundle the patched sglang + Megatron-LM source from the git submodules
# at third_party/* directly into the miles wheel. After `pip install miles`,
# the user gets miles, sglang, megatron.*, and miles_megatron_plugins all
# at the top level of site-packages — no separate `radixark-sglang` /
# `radixark-megatron` packages, no private index for the patched forks.
#
# Trade-off: a user who runs `pip install upstream-sglang` after
# `pip install miles` will overwrite the patched sglang. This is
# documented in README; the assumption is that miles is the primary
# install in its target environment.
