# from third_party/* into the miles wheel, the wheel contains *only*
# Python source — no compiled extensions are built during this packaging
# step (the GPU kernels in sglang are built at runtime via sgl-kernel,
# which is a separate PyPI package listed in extras_require["gpu"]).
#
# A pure-Python wheel must be tagged `py3-none-any` so it installs on any
# Python 3.x interpreter and any platform. Forcing a platform/ABI-specific
# tag (the previous behavior) made cp311 builds incompatible with the
# Python 3.12 production image.

# Bundle the patched sglang + Megatron-LM source from the git submodules
# at third_party/* directly into the miles wheel. After `pip install miles`,
# the user gets miles, sglang, megatron.*, and miles_megatron_plugins all
# at the top level of site-packages — no separate `radixark-sglang` /
# `radixark-megatron` packages, no private index for the patched forks.
#
# Trade-off: a user who runs `pip install upstream-sglang` after
# `pip install miles` will overwrite the patched sglang. This is
# documented in README; the assumption is that miles is the primary
# install in its target environment.
